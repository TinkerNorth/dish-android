# Dish Android

[![Android CI](https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-android/actions/workflows/android-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-android/actions/workflows/android-ci.yml)

Dish is an Android app that turns your phone into a wireless gamepad. It discovers Satellite servers on the local network, pairs with them, and streams controller input over UDP with minimal latency.

## Features

- **LAN Discovery** — automatically finds Satellite servers via UDP broadcast beacons
- **PIN Pairing** — secure TCP handshake with server-side PIN verification
- **Low-Latency Input** — controller reports sent via native `sendto()` directly from the input thread (no buffering)
- **Native NDK Backend** — C++ JNI layer handles networking and XUSB report packing
- **GameActivity Integration** — uses AndroidX GameActivity for the native loop while overlaying a Kotlin/View-based UI
- **Live Telemetry** — real-time display of event rate, sample rate, send rate, axis values, and button state
- **Gamepad Hot-Plug** — detects controller connect/disconnect events at runtime
- **Rumble** — game-side haptic events from the satellite (`MSG_RUMBLE`) drive the phone's `VibratorManager` / `Vibrator` for an in-hand buzz; see [Rumble](#rumble) below

## Architecture

```
Kotlin UI (MainActivity)
  ├── View Binding (scanning, server list, pairing, connected screens)
  ├── InputManager listener (gamepad hot-plug)
  └── dispatchKeyEvent / dispatchGenericMotionEvent
        └── SatelliteNative (JNI)
              └── satellite_jni.cpp
                    ├── UDP socket (sendReport → sendto)
                    ├── LAN discovery (discoverServers)
                    ├── TCP pairing (pair)
                    └── receiveAck → RumbleBridge.dispatchRumble (return path)
```

## Rumble

Rumble flows the opposite direction to the input hot path. A game on the
satellite host writes to the virtual controller's vibration channel, the
satellite forwards a `MSG_RUMBLE = 0x0009` packet back over the encrypted
UDP socket, and the dish actuates **the phone itself** via the system
vibrator service.

```
SatelliteNative.receiveAck (Kotlin Dispatchers.IO)
  └── satellite_jni.cpp::receiveAck
        ├── decrypt + parse MSG_RUMBLE
        └── env->CallStaticVoidMethod(RumbleBridge.dispatchRumble, ...)
              └── RumbleBridge.dispatchRumble
                    ├── API 31+ → VibratorManager.vibrate(CombinedVibration)
                    │              (strong → vibrator id 0,
                    │               weak   → vibrator id 1 if present)
                    └── legacy   → Vibrator.vibrate(VibrationEffect.createOneShot)
```

The wire format is documented in
[`satellite/README.md`](https://github.com/TinkerNorth/satellite#rumble-return-path).
Design notes specific to dish-android:

* **Phone, not pad.** All rumble is routed to the device's own vibrator(s)
  — there is no fallback path that tries to drive a connected physical
  gamepad's actuator. Letting the virtual on-screen pad / phone body
  handle every rumble keeps actuation single-rooted and avoids the
  "which device should buzz?" decision a player paired with a physical
  pad would otherwise have to make. This is intentional, not a TODO.
* **No dispatcher thread.** Unlike the Bluetooth bridge, rumble dispatch
  is synchronous on the JNI caller — `receiveAck` already runs on Kotlin
  `Dispatchers.IO`, which is JVM-attached, so we just call into Java
  directly with no queue or `AttachCurrentThread` ceremony.
* **Safety clamps.** Wire-format magnitudes (0..65535) map to
  `VibrationEffect`'s 1..255 amplitude with rounding-up so any non-zero
  request produces a perceptible buzz. Wire-format `durationMs` is
  clamped to `[1, 1500]` to bound the worst-case stranded buzz from a
  hung satellite.
* **Permission.** The manifest declares
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />`; no
  runtime prompt — VIBRATE is a normal-protection permission.
* **Lightbar is receive-and-log only.** Android exposes no controller-LED
  API, so the dedicated host lightbar signal (`MSG_LIGHTBAR = 0x000D`) is
  decoded and logged by the native receive loop, then dropped — there is
  no LED to drive on Android. dish-android also does not advertise
  `CAP_LIGHTBAR`, so a capability-aware satellite skips sending it.

The pure helpers (`rumbleMagnitudeTo255`, `rumbleSafeDurationMs`) are
covered by `app/src/test/java/.../RumbleBridgeHelpersTest.kt`.

## Requirements

- Android Studio Ladybug or newer
- Android SDK 36 (compile SDK)
- Android NDK with CMake 3.22.1+
- Min SDK: 24 (Android 7.0)
- JDK 11+

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-android.git
   cd dish-android
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   Open the project root directory in Android Studio. Gradle sync will download dependencies automatically.

3. **Build & Run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   Or use **Run ▶** in Android Studio to deploy to a connected device or emulator.

4. **Connect a gamepad** to your Android device (Bluetooth or USB) and launch the app. It will scan for Satellite servers on your LAN.

Shared config files live at the **repo root** (`TinkerNorth/`):
- `.clang-format` — C++ formatting rules (used by both Satellite and Dish JNI)
- `.clang-tidy` — C++ static analysis checks
- `.editorconfig` — whitespace/indentation rules for all file types

## Building

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Debug APK | `./gradlew assembleDebug` |
| Release APK | `./gradlew assembleRelease` |
| Run unit tests | `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` |

## Code Quality

### Kotlin

| Tool | Check | Auto-fix |
|------|-------|----------|
| **ktlint** (formatting + linting) | `./gradlew ktlintCheck` | `./gradlew ktlintFormat` |
| **detekt** (static analysis) | `./gradlew detekt` | — |
| **Android Lint** (Android-specific) | `./gradlew lint` | — |

### C++ / JNI (`app/src/main/cpp/`)

The JNI layer shares `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` with the Satellite server. Run from the **repo root**:

```bash
# Format
clang-format -i Dish/app/src/main/cpp/satellite_jni.cpp

# Compiler warnings (applied automatically via CMake)
# CMakeLists.txt uses: -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic
```

CI runs build + style (`android-ci.yml`) and security gates
(`security.yml`, `codeql.yml`) on every PR. The security workflow
includes the OWASP Dependency-Check Gradle plugin
(`./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze` — fails on CVSS >= 7.0), OSV-Scanner,
gitleaks, action-pin lint, and CodeQL `java-kotlin` + `cpp` analysis.

> **Note on branch protection.** GitHub's branch-protection and repository-
> ruleset features are not available for private repositories on the free
> org plan this repo lives under, so direct pushes to `main` are not
> blocked at the platform level. Treat the PR-based flow as a convention
> and rely on the CI workflows as the quality gate.

## Privacy

Public privacy policy:

mirrored in-repo at [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md). The policy is also
linked from the gear icon on the main screen → Settings → Privacy
policy. Short version: the app is LAN-only, makes no calls to
TinkerNorth-operated servers, and uses Firebase Crashlytics for crash
+ ANR reports only (stack traces, device model, install UUID — no
gamepad input, no satellite IPs, no SSIDs). Firebase Analytics is
deliberately not bundled, so no advertising ID is collected and no
auto-event telemetry fires. The crash-reporting opt-out toggle lives
on the same Settings screen → Diagnostics → *Share crash reports*.
The policy covers GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and LGPD inside the
